### IDEA TEMPLATE #####

# 1. Random Map Generator
# 2. Evaluate every visible point on the map. 
# 3. Assign points to every point on the map and rank. This will form the decision of the AI
# 4. Use a queue to push moves so that the moves can be reevaluated every time the agent moves "f" forward

### The Brain ###

1. The agent assesses each possible position on the global map. Each position is given a value.
2. Assessment is refreshed for all points within the view window
3. Treasure: The agent always completes a forward check to determine if he can or can't return to the original position before returning

4. Position Assessment:	

4A. Item in position 

	Points System (not on raft)				Value
	A. Walls (*)						0
	B. Land with FOG surrounding (?) 			1 per ? in 5x5 box
	C. Collectable Item w/ no items ('k', 'a', 'o')		10
	D. Collectable Items w/o losing items ('-', 'T')	0/10 (if agent has the prerequisite items)
	E. Water next to Land (~)				0/1 (1 if agent has prerequisite items (raft or stone))
	F. Water surrounded by Water				0
	G. Treasure ($)						0/10000 (If agent can return to original starting point

	Points System (on raft)					Value
	A. Water (on raft) with FOG surrounding (?)		10 per ? In 5x5 box
	D. Tree ('T')						0/10 (if agent has the axe)
	E. Door	('-')						0/9 (if agent has key)
	
	

4B. Distance from agent						Short distances are higher value
								Each unit of distance = -1 point
								

4C. Reachable without items					+50
    Reachable with items					+0
    Unreachable							*0 (Prune the tree)

### Decision Tree ###

Pruning
- if not reachable, then it is not considered
